    <h1>Checking GitHub from Git</h1>
    <h2>Do You know that there are 3 ways to interact with github</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>HTTPS</li>
      <li>SSH</li>
      <li>GitHub CLI</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>HTTPS</h3>
    <p>
      The use of password to gain access to your remote Repositories that is
      GitHub from the git command line has been stopped, so how do we access our
      github Repositories on GitHub?
    </p>
    <h2>What has Replaced the use of passwords?</h2>
    <p>They are 2 types of personal access tokens(pat):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>fine-grained personal access token</li>
      <li>personal access token (classic)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Do You Know that Public Repositories can Configure their repo to restrict
      the access of personal access token (classic)
    </h2>
    <p>
      If you try to use a personal access token (classic) to access resources in
      an organization that has disabled personal access token (classic) access,
      your request will fail with a 403 response. instead you should use any of
      these:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub App, or</li>
      <li>OAuth app,</li>
      <li>fine-grained personal access token.</li>
    </ul>
