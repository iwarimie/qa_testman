I changed my github promary email and want to test to see if everything is working fine

##Do You Know That You Cannot make a push request from the command line using email and password?
Now you would need a personal access token to push to github

##GitHub currently supports two types of personal access tokens:
- fine-grained personal access tokens(Recommended)
- personal access tokens (classic)

#fine-grained personal access tokens(Recommended)
There are resources you can access using this fine-grained personal access token and it provides restrictions to the resources that can be accessed using this token. 

#personal access tokens (classic)
This token is less secure because if you use it, you can access organisational public repositories and at the same time everyone can see your private repositories. There are time an organisation or public repository you want to access has blocked the use of personal access tokens(classic) to view resources in that case you would need either of these apps to access the public repository which has configured their repo to not grant you access using personal access tokens(classic) they are: 
- GitHub App, 
- OAuth app, or 
- fine-grained personal access token.
